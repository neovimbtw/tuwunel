# Tuwunel MSC Implementation Status

## Columns

- **Inv**: inventory status (matrix-spec-proposals state). One of
  `merged`, `open`, `closed`, `unknown`.
- **Status**: ✅ `yes` / 🟨 `partial` / ❌ `no` / ⬛ `n/a` /
  ❔ `?` (never assessed; a question not yet asked, which is
  not the same claim as `no`),
  followed by a confidence glyph (● high / ◐ med / ○ low /
  · unknown) that reflects confidence in the assessment, not
  in the implementation.
- **Impl**: two percentages, `correct/impl`, e.g. `70/80`.
  - **correct**: the share Tuwunel adheres to correctly.
  - **impl**: the share with any code path attempting adherence,
    so `correct` never exceeds `impl`. Either may be `?`.
  - **denominator**: the MSC's homeserver-applicable scope, the
    requirements a homeserver itself must satisfy.
  - **requirement**: any requirement-shaped statement, not just
    MUST/SHOULD. Proposals are loosely normative, so "the server
    returns X" and "this field is added to Y" both count.
- **Spec**: the Matrix spec version that first published the MSC,
  in the [Spec compliance gaps](#spec-compliance-gaps) section
  only. `next` is queued for the release after `1.19`. Blank
  means no changelog from `1.1` on cites the MSC, so it was either
  adopted into the pre-`1.1` spec or has not landed in a release.

## Out of scope

MSCs marked `n/a`: the homeserver-applicable scope is empty
(addressed to an identity server, integration manager, widget or
client only, or governance/process), or the MSC is unimplemented and
superseded by another MSC. Scope is a property of the proposal, not
of what Tuwunel has chosen to build. Listed here for
audit; the `Inv` column carries each row's inventory bucket in
place of the (uniformly empty) `Impl` cell.

| MSC | Status | Inv | Title | Note |
